                            provided me with a wealth of indelible memories. Upon

                            and facilities had exceeded my expectations and left
                            me in awe. As a student of Psychology, I am amazed by
                            the top-tier faculty, enriching classroom environment,
                            and comprehensive educational resources available at
                            this institution. This environment has not only
                            deepened my knowledge, but also inspired me to pursue
                            excellence in my studies. I am confident that the
                            knowledge and experiences gained here will serve as a
                            solid foundation for my future endeavours. With all
                            the support and holistic education, alongside the

                            (Department of Psychology). The psychology department
                            was always close to my heart and my faculty members
                            were always supportive. Apart from academics I was
                            always keen towards my passion that is singing and RGU
                            had been that pillar through which I could embrace my
                            skills on various occasions. The lavish infrastructure
                            has also been a reason for my smooth undergraduate
                            journey."

                            Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati was the best
                            moment of my life. At first I was curious about how my
                            Under-Graduate life would go here as it was my first
                            experience at a university. But when I completed my
                            course in B.A. Applied Psychology and the time had
                            come to finally leave RGU and bid farewell to my
                            teachers and friends, at that very moment I realized
                            that it was really a memorable time to have enjoyed
                            such a wonderful student life in the campus. The
                            sophisticated infrastructure with all the necessary
                            facilities like library, canteens, hostels, gyms,
                            sports etc. provided us a homely and clean environment
                            for teaching and learning. The teaching staffs of
                            Psychology department are very friendly and
                            cooperative. With all the cherished recollections that
                            I have experienced in RGU, I can honestly say that I
                            have graduated from one of the best universities of
                            North-East India.”
