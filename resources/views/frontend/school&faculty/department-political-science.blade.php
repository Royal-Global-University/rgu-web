          many research papers in reputed journals, and a dedicated laboratory
          in-charge to help the students individually during the laboratory
          period. Fully dedicated faculties from 9:00am to 5:15pm and all the
          laboratories are well equipped with all the necessary instruments with
          four laboratories, including one dark room and one research lab with
          remedial and guidance classes for different competitive examinations
          from time to time. The weakness are Lack of work-life balance and Lack
          of or too much spontaneity. Students are inspired and guided to pursue
          research after PG and are also encouraged and guided to learn practical
          skills. And are motivated to acquire leadership skills by guiding them
          to organize departmental/school events from time to time. To create

          innovation and entrepreneurship and qualify for competitive examinations
          like NET/GATE/SLAT/UPSC/APSC etc.The department faculties encourage

                            transformative periods of my life. Choosing Master’s
                            in political science as my field of study was driven
                            by my passion for learning more about different
                            theories and international relations. I had the
                            opportunity to work on projects that deepened my
                            understanding. The professors were knowledgeable and
                            supportive, often going the extra mile to help
                            students succeed.<br />Outside the classroom, I also
                            participated in Yuvamanthan which helped me in gaining
                            more knowledge and experience outside the curriculum.
                            Our university is not just about academic growth; but
                            it also encourages personal development. I learned a
                            lot about myself, from my strengths and weaknesses to
                            my passions and career aspirations. This experience
                            helped me become more independent, confident, and
                            adaptable. It also prepared me for the challenges and
                            opportunities ahead, and I am grateful for every
                            moment. It taught me that education extends beyond the
                            classroom, and the experiences and relationships I
                            built in here will always hold a special place in my
                            heart. ”

                            been a very vibrant and transformative one. Being part
                            of this prestigious institution has in fact lead to an
                            overall development of my personality. One of the best
                            parts about RGU is that it provides its students an
                            environment where one can really be themselves and
                            truly express and understand as to who they really are
                            as individuals. This place, apart from academics, has
                            also taught me many more life skills such as
                            inculcating leadership qualities, ability to work and
                            handle situations in diverse circumstances , improving
                            my public speaking skills and hence gave me a sense of
                            confidence and belief in myself. Moreover, the
                            cooperation, encourage and support shown by my
                            teachers has made my learning experience in the
                            institution seamless and enjoyable.Another
                            highlighting aspect of RGU is that it provides us with
                            many creative ways to enhance our knowledge and
                            extracurricular skills apart from the classroom
                            studies. Through various seminars, speeches and
                            programmes which are very frequently held in the
                            institution, it has provided me with many new
                            opportunities to participate in events from various
                            fields which are some of the most enjoyable
                            experiences that I'll always cherish. The institution
                            makes sure that the best of resources are provided to
                            its students, the top notch infrastructural
                            facilities, pleasant environment in the campus, a
                            resourceful library and hygienic canteen facilities
                            has made my life in the campus enjoyable.Overall, it
                            is a privilege to be a part of this institution as a
                            student pursuing my master’s degree in political
                            science. I will be forever thankful to RGU for
                            moulding me as a person and being able to realise the
                            confidence and self-belief in me to handle any
                            situation that life puts in front of me. ”
