            <h2 class="mobile-headd2">RGU’s APPROACH
            </h2>
            <p>
                RGU aspires to be recognized for the quality and impact of its research output on the current state of
                knowledge. Towards this goal, it will strive to provide an environment where cutting-edge research is done
                by a community of scholars where the focus is placed on conceptual clarity and the utilization and
                development of new methodologies that are employed not only to illuminate the issue under study but also in
                a wide range of contexts. Ph.D. scholars will work, through collaborations and joint projects, on real-world
                issues in close association with outside organizations/industries and apply appropriate and innovative
                methodologies to address their problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                The structure of the Ph.D. programme includes a mandatory coursework and candidates are encouraged to take
                up a wide variety of courses to cultivate a cross-disciplinary outlook. The topic of research is expected to
                be inter-disciplinary with emphasis on practical impact that is inspired by real world problems or sponsored
                by industry. The output is expected to address a gap or add something new to the existing corpus of
                literature. A Ph.D. scholar is not only preparing to be a researcher but also a teacher as teaching is
                integral to effective learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the spirit of liberal inquiry governing every aspect of academic life, accomplished faculty, emphasis
                on work-life balance, a close and supportive environment, and access to world-class facilities, being a
                research scholar at RGU will be an enriching, and productive experience.

                                    organized by their department. These programs focus on essential skills such as
                                    pedagogy, research report writing, and paper writing. Furthermore, students may be
                                    assigned teaching responsibilities for specific periods, as determined by their guide
                                    and communicated to the DRC.<br><br>

                                    <strong class="text-primary">Ph.D. PROGRAM:</strong> At the end of each semester, the
                                    Departmental Research Committee
                                    (DRC) assesses the progress of a Ph.D. student's research work. If the work is
                                    satisfactory, the student is recommended to proceed to the next semester. If the
                                    progress is unsatisfactory for two consecutive semesters, the DRC suggests corrective
                                    measures. If the student fails to implement these measures, the DRC may recommend the
                                    cancellation of the student's registration to the University Research Committee (URC).
                                    Upon completing the research work, the DRC evaluates the entire progress and may
                                    recommend the student for Pre-Thesis Submission, where the student presents their
                                    research in a seminar before the DRC. The student must fulfil requirements such as
                                    publishing at least one research article in a peer-reviewed, SCOPUS indexed or UGC CARE
                                    listed journal and presenting their research at two national or international
                                    conferences/seminars. After meeting these requirements, the student submits an abstract
                                    of their research, approximately 1500 words, in eight copies in both hard and soft forms
                                    to the DRC within two months of the successful Pre-Thesis Submission Seminar. If the DRC
                                    approves the abstract, it is forwarded to the URC for approval. Before final submission,
                                    the draft thesis must undergo a plagiarism check at the university's central library,
                                    ensuring content similarity does not exceed 10%, in accordance with UGC regulations[The
                                    Section 8 (i-iv) of the UGC (Promotion of academic Integrity and Prevention of
                                    Plagiarism in higher education institutions) regulations, 2018, F.I-18/2010 (CPP-II,
                                    Dared 23rd July 2018)]. Any violations are reported to the University Academic Integrity
                                    Maintenance Committee. On the recommendation of the DRC, Ph.D. students are requiredto
                                    submit three printed copies (four if a Co-Guide is involved) initially in spiral-bound
                                    format, accompanied by a soft copy to the Controller of Examinations. Each thesis must
                                    undergo rigorous scrutiny for plagiarism, certified by university authorities. The Ph.D.
                                    Guide and any Co-Guide must attest to the originality of the work and confirm it has not
                                    been submitted elsewhere for another degree. Submission must occur within three months
                                    of DRC's approval of the thesis abstract. The thesis is to be written in the English
                                    language in accordance with the University Guidelines for writing a Ph.D. Thesis.
                                    Following submission, a panel of five external examiners, chosen by the Vice Chancellor,
                                    assesses the thesis. These examiners, appointed based on their expertise in relevant
                                    fields, are required to submit detailed reports within six weeks, with an option for
                                    extension in justified cases. Evaluation outcomes include acceptance for the Ph.D.
                                    degree, acceptance pending minor modifications, revision and resubmission, or outright
                                    rejection. Successful candidates proceed to an Oral Defence Examination, ideally
                                    scheduled within a month of examiner approval, where they present and defend their
                                    research before the Oral Defence
                                    Examination Committee (ODEC). Upon favourable recommendation by the ODEC, the Vice
                                    Chancellor oversees the final steps leading to the awarding of the Ph.D. degree, subject
                                    to ratification by the Academic Council and Board of Management.<br>

                In particular, RGU doctoral programme aims to train the researchers who extend the boundaries of current
                knowledge and are also able to create new knowledge, are adept in the use of traditional methodologies and
                latest tools and build on these to develop new techniques to answer questions that transcend disciplinary
                boundaries, can communicate clearly and effectively to the expert and the public at large the insights
                gleaned from the research, can apply the skills and knowledge in practical contexts.

            <p class="para1 text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">
                RGU aspires to be recognized for the quality and impact of its research output on the current state of
                knowledge. Towards this goal, it will strive to provide an environment where cutting-edge research is done
                by a community of scholars where the focus is placed on conceptual clarity and the utilization and
                development of new methodologies that are employed not only to illuminate the issue under study but also in
                a wide range of contexts. Ph.D. scholars will work, through collaborations and joint projects, on real-world
                issues in close association with outside organizations/industries and apply appropriate and innovative
                methodologies to address their problems.
            </p>
            <p class="para1 text-dark" style="text-align: justify;">
                The structure of the Ph.D. programme includes a mandatory coursework and candidates are encouraged to take
                up
                a wide variety of courses to cultivate a cross-disciplinary outlook. The topic of research is expected to be
                inter-disciplinary with emphasis on practical impact that is inspired by real world problems or sponsored by
                industry. The output is expected to address a gap or add something new to the existing corpus of literature.
                A Ph.D. scholar is not only preparing to be a researcher but also a teacher as teaching is integral to
                effective learning.
            </p>
            <p class="para1 text-dark">
                With the spirit of liberal inquiry governing every aspect of academic life, accomplished faculty, emphasis
                on work-life balance, a close and supportive environment, and access to world-class facilities, being a
                research scholar at RGU will be an enriching, and productive experience.

                                    successfully complete a 12-credit
                                    course load during their first two semesters. This coursework includes two compulsory
                                    courses: one on Research Methodology and another on Research and Publication Ethics.
                                    Additionally, students must take a subject-specific course prescribed by their
                                    respective Student Research Committee (SRC) and Departmental Research Committee (DRC).
                                    To ensure continued eligibility in the Ph.D. program, students must achieve a minimum
                                    grade of 55% or its equivalent on a 10-point scale in each course. Beyond formal
                                    coursework, Ph.D. students are also expected to participate in various training programs
                                    organized by their department. These programs focus on essential skills such as
                                    pedagogy, research report writing, and paper writing. Furthermore, students may be
                                    assigned teaching responsibilities for specific periods, as determined by their guide
                                    and communicated to the DRC.<br><br>

                                    <strong class="text-primary">Ph.D. PROGRAM:</strong> At the end of each semester, the
                                    Departmental Research Committee
                                    (DRC) assesses the progress of a Ph.D. student's research work. If the work is
                                    satisfactory, the student is recommended to proceed to the next semester. If the
                                    progress is unsatisfactory for two consecutive semesters, the DRC suggests corrective
                                    measures. If the student fails to implement these measures, the DRC may recommend the
                                    cancellation of the student's registration to the University Research Committee (URC).
                                    Upon completing the research work, the DRC evaluates the entire progress and may
                                    recommend the student for Pre-Thesis Submission, where the student presents their
                                    research in a seminar before the DRC. The student must fulfil requirements such as
                                    publishing at least one research article in a peer-reviewed, SCOPUS indexed or UGC CARE
                                    listed journal and presenting their research at two national or international
                                    conferences/seminars. After meeting these requirements, the student submits an abstract
                                    of their research, approximately 1500 words, in eight copies in both hard and soft forms
                                    to the DRC within two months of the successful Pre-Thesis Submission Seminar. If the DRC
                                    approves the abstract, it is forwarded to the URC for approval. Before final submission,
                                    the draft thesis must undergo a plagiarism check at the university's central library,
                                    ensuring content similarity does not exceed 10%, in accordance with UGC regulations[The
                                    Section 8 (i-iv) of the UGC (Promotion of academic Integrity and Prevention of
                                    Plagiarism in higher education institutions) regulations, 2018, F.I-18/2010 (CPP-II,
                                    Dared 23rd July 2018)]. Any violations are reported to the University Academic Integrity
                                    Maintenance Committee. On the recommendation of the DRC, Ph.D. students are requiredto
                                    submit three printed copies (four if a Co-Guide is involved) initially in spiral-bound
                                    format, accompanied by a soft copy to the Controller of Examinations. Each thesis must
                                    undergo rigorous scrutiny for plagiarism, certified by university authorities. The Ph.D.
                                    Guide and any Co-Guide must attest to the originality of the work and confirm it has not
                                    been submitted elsewhere for another degree. Submission must occur within three months
                                    of DRC's approval of the thesis abstract. The thesis is to be written in the English
                                    language in accordance with the University Guidelines for writing a Ph.D. Thesis.
                                    Following submission, a panel of five external examiners, chosen by the Vice Chancellor,
                                    assesses the thesis. These examiners, appointed based on their expertise in relevant
                                    fields, are required to submit detailed reports within six weeks, with an option for
                                    extension in justified cases. Evaluation outcomes include acceptance for the Ph.D.
                                    degree, acceptance pending minor modifications, revision and resubmission, or outright
                                    rejection. Successful candidates proceed to an Oral Defence Examination, ideally
                                    scheduled within a month of examiner approval, where they present and defend their
                                    research before the Oral Defence
                                    Examination Committee (ODEC). Upon favourable recommendation by the ODEC, the Vice
                                    Chancellor oversees the final steps leading to the awarding of the Ph.D. degree, subject
                                    to ratification by the Academic Council and Board of Management.<br>
