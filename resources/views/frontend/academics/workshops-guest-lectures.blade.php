                    Sreyashi Mukherjee in her talk entitled “Utterly Amul: Recasting Hybridizations of Nation
                    and Womanhood” presented research carried out by her at Drexel University, Philadelphia,
                    USA. She began by portraying the rise of Amul in 1946 through the efforts of Dr. Verghese
                    Kurien and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. She argued that the Amul product caught the
                    attention of the nation when in 1966 it began its advertising campaign with the
                    ungrammatical but fun tagline, “Utterly Butterly Amul”.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Mukherjee’s research showed how a young nation was presented through the
                    advertising campaign and how the trajectory of the nation was reflected through the years by Amul,
                    touching upon key issues of politics, gender and identity. Apparently fun, tongue in cheek media
                    comments are politically and sociologically significant, was how Dr. Mukherjee concluded the session.

                            it involves learning only few skills. Project work and workshops redresses this balance, by
                            fostering a wide range of skills and enhancing capabilities to synthesize, articulate,
                            define problems, formulate hypotheses, experiment, analyze, interpret, plan and execute
                            the results of an experiment or investigation and draw conclusions from data. Project work
